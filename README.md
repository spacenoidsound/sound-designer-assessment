~Sound Design Overview
1.  The sounds I contributed were predominately ambiences, including the day and night forest sounds, the UI sound, footstep and jump sounds. 
2.  The footstep and jump sounds were samples I found from Splice and then edited them in Reaper to work better once implemented.  
3.  I created the UI sound in Reaper with Arturia Pigments only.
4.  I created the ambiences with a mixture of sample libraries of forest style sounds and synth textures.  These were edited in Pro Tools.
5.  I then added these clips to the AudioSources

~Observation of audio development process
1. Since I was focused on getting the essentials done, I mainly sourced in the sounds I could not easily get immediately (i.e. forest sounds) and then created the more immediate sounds (i.e. UI sounds) first.
2. At first I had a little bit of trouble navigating a way to add the footstep sounds to the animation, however, this project didn't have any animation models available to add scripts to; I tried a couple, but they would not work with this project.  So I opted to use the scripts that were available in the Character Audio object and edited the footstep audio files further down as best I could so they could sound somewhat timed with the animation footsteps.
3. Adjusted levels on the AudioSources to make the balance work better prioritizing the more active sounds like footsteps and UI.

Thanks for reviewing my take on the sound designer assignment!
